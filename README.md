# project
Brief description of the project:
We have implemented an example of an online book store.
In this project, users are divided into two types, buyers and sellers, and each user can perform a series of actions according to their access level.
For example, the seller has the ability to add books for sale, but the buyer is deprived of this feature.
Then a graphical interface was designed for the program.
Graphic interfaces related to login page, registration page, home page and book list page.

this is the first class diagram of project
some features were deleted or added and other maybe have some changes
